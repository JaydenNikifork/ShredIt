# Shred It
## About
Shred It is a rhythm game meant to somewhat mimick how the guitar is played. Players must play the notes that fall from the ceiling once they align with the tempo bar in order to gain points. If players miss the notes, they will instead lose points.
This game was built with the Unity game engine in a 2D environment.
